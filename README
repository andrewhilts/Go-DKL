**************************************

This software is based on the creation of 'project models'. Project models are essentially a series of nodes and their interrelationships. The models are built when the user selects interesting goals and includes them in his/her project. The project models are generated from these included goals and the system automatically retrieves all contributings elements, which are also included in the project model. The user can then browse and reconfigure the project model using the tree list tool, and generate reports based on them.

See www.designknowledge.org/about.html (essentially chapter 5 of my thesis) for a more detailed high-level description as well as a process and data model.
